  -n PROVIDERNAME, --providername PROVIDERNAME
                        Host IPTV provider name

Config file based setup
                        No parameters required
                        The script will create a default config file
                        first time it is run, IPTV providers details
                        need to be entered into this file before
                        running the script again
```

## Pre Requisites
EPG-Importer plugin is required. This should be available in the plugin feed or already installed.

N.B. OpenPLi may need additional packages installed. If you attempt to run the script and get an error about
missing modules please run
```
opkg update
opkg install python-image python-imaging python-argparse
```

## How to install
* FTP the e2m3u2bouquet.py to your engima2 box (I would suggest to /etc/enigma2/e2m3u2bouquet)
* SSH to your enigma2 box (using putty or something similar)
* CD to the correct directory if you are not already there
```
cd /etc/enigma2/e2m3u2bouquet
```
* Make script executable
```
chmod 755 e2m3u2bouquet.py
```

## URL Based Setup
Run the script passing the url for your m3u file and the url for your providers XML TV data feed
```
./e2m3u2bouquet.py -m "http://provider_url/get.php?username=YOURUSERNAME&password=YOURPASSWORD&type=m3u_plus&output=ts" -e "http://provider_url/xmltv.php?username=YOURUSERNAME&password=YOURPASSWORD"
```
**NB: you need to replace the username and password values X 2**

If you are with a different provider the script should work but you will obviously need the m3u url (1st parameter) and XML TV url (2nd parameter) for your own provider. Please note the m3u file needs to be the "extended" version if you have the option.

## Config File Setup
No parameters required, just run the script
```
./e2m3u2bouquet.py
```
The script will create a default config.xml file in /etc/enigma2/e2m3u2bouquet the first time it is run
IPTV providers details need to be entered into this file before running the script again

Note: Multiple IPTV providers can be supported via the config.xml

## For Picon Download Support
Add -P and optionally -q /path/to/picon/folder/ if you don't store your picons in the default location. The default location
is `/usr/share/enigma2/picon/` (internal flash) other enigma2 picon search location are `/media/usb/picon/` & `/media/hdd/picon/`.

N.B. If you store the picons on HDD it was spin up whenever they are shown

```
./e2m3u2bouquet.py "http://provider_url/get.php?username=YOURUSERNAME&password=YOURPASSWORD&type=m3u_plus&output=ts" -e "http://provider_url/xmltv.php?username=YOURUSERNAME&password=YOURPASSWORD" -P
```

## Specify all stream types to be IPTV
Default is DVB stream types for live channels and IPTV for VOD, all IPTV type streams may be required if you are unable to record channels.
```
./e2m3u2bouquet.py "http://provider_url/get.php?username=YOURUSERNAME&password=YOURPASSWORD&type=m3u_plus&output=ts" -e "http://provider_url/xmltv.php?username=YOURUSERNAME&password=YOURPASSWORD" -i
```

## Keep VOD all in a single bouquet
./e2m3u2bouquet.py "http://provider_url/get.php?username=YOURUSERNAME&password=YOURPASSWORD&type=m3u_plus&output=ts" -e "http://provider_url/xmltv.php?username=YOURUSERNAME&password=YOURPASSWORD" -s

## Uninstall
./e2m3u2bouquet.py -U

## Help!
```
./e2m3u2bouquet.py --help
```

## Importing EPG Data
* Open EPG-Importer plugin (download it if you haven't already got it)
* Select sources (Blue button on OpenVix)
* Enable the source created by the script (listed under IPTV Bouquet Maker - E2m3u2bouquet)
* Kick off a manual EPG import

## Updating Channels
To update the channels simply run this script again. A scheduled script can
be set up to automate this process (see below)

## Automate channel updates (set up from SSH)
* If your box doesn't already have cron then install it
```
opkg install busybox-cron
```
* open crontab for editing
```
crontab -e
```
Once open press i to switch to INSERT mode enter the following (retype or ctrl-v to paste)
This will automatically run the script at 06:00 & 18:00 every day
```
0 6,18 * * * /etc/enigma2/e2m3u2bouquet/e2m3u2bouquet.py -m "http://provider_url/get.php?username=YOURUSERNAME&password=YOURPASSWORD&type=m3u_plus&output=ts" -e "http://provider_url/xmltv.php?username=YOURUSERNAME&password=YOURPASSWORD"
```
or
```
0 6,18 * * * /etc/enigma2/e2m3u2bouquet/e2m3u2bouquet.py
```
Press ESC follwed by :wq to exit the cron editor and save the entry
You can check the entry with the command below
```
crontab -l
```

(Depending on your box image installing nano `opkg install nano` may set it as the default editor
which makes editing the crontab easier)

## Automate Channel Updates (set up from box GUI)
* Go to 'Menu -> Timers -> CronTimers
* Select the required update frequency
* For the command to run enter i.e. to run at 06:00 & 18:00 enter
```
0 6,18 * * * cd /home/root && ./e2m3u2bouquet.py
```
* Ensure that cron Autostart is active

## Custom Mapping
* Run the script once. It will create `provider_name-sort-current.xml`
* FTP `provider_name-sort-current.xml` to your machine and rename it `provider_name-sort-override.xml`
* For custom bouquet order move the `<category` lines within `<mapping> -> <categories>`
* To disable a bouquet change `enabled="true"` to `enabled="false"`
* For custom channel ordering within a bouquet move the `<channel` lines within `<mapping> -> <channels>`
* To disable a channel change `enabled="true"` to `enabled="false"`
* To change the id used for XML EPG mapping update the `tvg-id` attribute
* To change the service ref (e.g. to map to an existing satellite EPG feed) change the `serviceRef` attribute
  * For example to use the Channel 4 HD DVB-S EPG you would set the serviceRef to "1:0:1:**52D0:814:2:11A0000**:0:0:0" (part in bold SID:TID:NID:Namespace needs to match). If you match a DVB service and also set the streamUrl to blank the DVB service will replace the IPTV service
* FTP `provider_name-sort-override.xml` to your box
* Run the script again and the changes made will be applied
